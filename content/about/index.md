I've been a professional software developer since the start of 2009 and I *love*
my job. Honestly, if money wasn't an issue then I'd be doing the same thing for
free. I love building things and learning so this is the perfect industry for
me.

Early on I did a lot of Java webapps. These days I'm doing Vue.js based apps
that connect to whatever server we're using for the job.

I guess the best classification for me is "web developer" but when working in
small teams you never have one role. I'm the person who gets whatever needs doing
done. I don't know how long this term will survive for but let's just say DevOps.

I really enjoy mentoring and teaching so this blog is a way for me to share the
knowledge I have with others. I only post when I have something that *needs* to
be said. For me, that's when I have a solution that isn't available elsewhere on
the web.

Oh, I also designed a mechanical keyboard. The
[ErgoSlab](https://github.com/tomsaleeba/ergoslab). I stood on the shoulders of
giants to achieve it but I'm still super proud of it and I'm typing this on it
right now.
