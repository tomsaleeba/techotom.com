The `script.js` file loads itself into the page and does syntax highlighting. I think it's neat.

## Run it
...with any web server. There's no building required. Something like
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337
```
...will get you going. Then open http://localhost:1337

## TODO
  1. add lots more details
  1. add examples of other languages
  1. add line numbers
  1. add favicon
  1. can we prerender the whole thing to static HTML with https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer?
