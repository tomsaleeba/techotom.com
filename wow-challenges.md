- making an upload process for both with/without service worker
- dealing with upload workflow that requires multiple requests
- polyfilling browsers that don't have support we need
- serialisation issues with IDB
- state management around saving observations, uploading in the background and
    allowing users to continue to edit/delete the obs
- build chain that lets us share code between the service worker and main thread
